## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Netlify Functions + MySQL Issue

**Problem:** Netlify Functions are serverless and don't work well with traditional MySQL because:
- No persistent database connections
- Connection pooling doesn't work
- Each request creates new DB connection (slow & unstable)

---

## üéØ Best Deployment Options (Choose One)

### **Option 1: PlanetScale + Netlify (Recommended - FREE)**

PlanetScale is a serverless MySQL database that works perfectly with Netlify Functions!

#### Steps:
1. **Create PlanetScale Database** (5 min)
   - Go to: https://planetscale.com
   - Sign up (free)
   - Create database: `clinisync`
   - Get connection credentials

2. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   ```
   Go to: https://app.netlify.com/start
   
   Settings:
   Base directory:      frontend
   Build command:       cd .. && npm install && cd frontend && npm run build
   Publish directory:   dist
   Functions directory: ../netlify/functions
   
   Environment Variables:
   VITE_API_URL   = /api
   NODE_VERSION   = 20
   DB_HOST        = [from PlanetScale]
   DB_USER        = [from PlanetScale]
   DB_PASSWORD    = [from PlanetScale]
   DB_NAME        = clinisync
   DB_PORT        = 3306
   JWT_SECRET     = your-secret-key
   ```

3. **Initialize Database:**
   - In PlanetScale Console, run your `database/schema.sql`
   - Create system admin manually

**Cost:** $0/month  
**Speed:** Fast  
**Reliability:** High ‚úÖ

### **Option 2: Frontend (Netlify) + Backend (Railway)**

Keep frontend and backend separate.

#### Steps:

**A. Deploy Backend to Railway:**
1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. New Project ‚Üí Deploy from GitHub: `rachid-el-adnani/clinisync`
3. Add MySQL database service
4. Set environment variables (JWT_SECRET, etc.)
5. Get Railway URL (e.g., `https://clinisync-production.up.railway.app`)

**B. Deploy Frontend to Netlify:**
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/start
2. Settings:
   ```
   Base directory:      frontend
   Build command:       npm install && npm run build
   Publish directory:   dist
   
   Environment Variables:
   VITE_API_URL = https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api
   ```

**C. Update Railway CORS:**
   - Add `FRONTEND_URL` = your Netlify URL

**Cost:** $5-10/month (Railway)  
**Speed:** Fast  
**Reliability:** High ‚úÖ

---

### **Option 3: All-in-One (Render - FREE)**

Deploy everything to Render (supports MySQL).

#### Steps:
1. Go to: https://render.com
2. New Web Service ‚Üí Connect GitHub
3. Render auto-detects and deploys
4. Add PostgreSQL database (free tier)
5. Update code to use PostgreSQL instead of MySQL

**Cost:** $0/month  
**Speed:** Medium  
**Reliability:** Medium

---

### **Option 4: Vercel (Full Stack)**

Similar to Netlify but with better serverless support.

#### Steps:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
2. Import: `rachid-el-adnani/clinisync`
3. Use PlanetScale for MySQL
4. Configure environment variables
5. Deploy

**Cost:** $0/month (with PlanetScale)  
**Speed:** Very Fast  
**Reliability:** High ‚úÖ
